# InvoiceApp

This project is an Angular-based application designed for managing invoices efficiently.

## Development Server

To start the application locally, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile the project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not include an e2e testing framework by default, so you may need to configure one separately.

## User Accounts

Pre-created user accounts:

- **User:** user@user.com | Password: 123456
- **Admin:** admin@admin.com | Password: 123456

New accounts can be created, but they will always have standard user privileges.

## Hosting

The application is hosted on **Vercel** due to cost considerations.
